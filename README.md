In the era of big data, the demand for image analysis is increasing, and using neural
network models in data analysis is highly efficient in various fields. Image classification can
help media platforms like youtube to recommend suitable content according to the covers of
different video clips. Moreover, some wide-use object detection technologies can not stand
alone without the support of image classification. Therefore, a well-performing image
classification model with accurate prediction is significant, which is the primary motivation
of our research.
